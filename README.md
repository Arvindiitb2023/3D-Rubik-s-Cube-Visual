# 3D-Rubik-s-Cube-Visual

A visual 3D simulation of a Rubik’s Cube built in Python. This project allows users to interact with the cube using keyboard controls to perform standard cube moves.

## Features

- Full 3D cube rendering
- Supports all standard Rubik’s Cube moves via keyboard
- Real-time rotation and face updates
- Accurate cube state tracking
- Solves Using Kociemba library

## Tools Used

- Python 3
- PyOpenGL
- Custom cube representation and move logic
- PyQt6
## Logic
- Main logic for Cube is all faces are sticker

## What left to do?
- Want to make a Feature where players can scramble cube using OpenCV or manual selecting Colors of Faces
Would be happy if you contribute to it
